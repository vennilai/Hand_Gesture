# Hand_Gesture
Hand_Gesture is a Project where we can control our system using our hand movements. Insted of using mouse we can control our system by hands.

In today’s world we see lots of development in the technology field. Today’s technology is combined with the technique called Artificial Intelligence. This project is also based on a small part of AI. This project presents two hands movement gesture detection on our computer’s window using a camera and handling the whole system by just moving your hands. Our idea is to completely control our PC using hand gestures. At first, we will implement it in the windows operating system. Topic grants you control over the system’s most commonly used and important functions literally at your fingertips and in the palm of your hand using just the webcam.Using finger detection methods for instant access and a user-friendly user interface makes it more easily accessible. The system is used to implement a motion tracking mouse, a signature input device, and an application selector. This system reduces the use of any physical mouse which saves time and also reduces effort.

**Algorithm:**

The AI virtual mouse system makes use of the Transformational algorithm, and it converts the co-ordinates of fingertip from the webcam screen to the computer window full screen for controlling the mouse. When the hands are detected and when we find which finger is up for performing the specific mouse function, a rectangular box is drawn with respect to the computer window in the webcam region where we move throughout the window using the mouse cursor

3.Virtual Screen Matching Rectangular Region for Moving through the Window

4.Detecting Which Finger Is Up and Performing the Particular Mouse Function

5.Mouse Functions Depending on the Hand Gestures and Hand Tip Detection Using Computer Vision
